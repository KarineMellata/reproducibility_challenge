# [ICLR 2018 Reproducibility Challenge](http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ICLR2018-ReproducibilityChallenge.html)

We have chosen from the 2018 ICLR submissions to reproduce [Generative Models of Visually Grounded Imagination](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.10762.pdf). We will first try to reproduce the JMVAE method.
